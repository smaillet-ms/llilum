Description:
  This propertysheet project file defines the Llilum build system properties and settings
  for this BSP as a NUGET package.

  <PropertyGroup>
    <!--
    Nuget only auto imports the props files matching the package name (Without version) so only this file is auto imported
    The project templates for native code inlude a conditional import for a property sheet using this property as the 
    condition and path to the property sheet. The reason for this convolved approach is due to the necessity to achieve 
    proper import ordering of the property sheet. Since NUGET will place imports at the beginning of the project file,
    before other imports the ItemDefinition groups would be overridden by the default settings in the general build
    infrastucture if they were included in this file. However, if they are imported at the expected PropertySheet
    extensibility point everything works as expected.
